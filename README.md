## ‚≠ê Features

- **WinUI controls samples:** each control page shows the markup and codebehind used to create each example.

- **Use the Microsoft.UI.Xaml (WinUI) library:** the app includes the latest WinUI NuGet package and shows how to use the [WinUI](https://docs.microsoft.com/windows/apps/winui/) controls like NavigationView, SwipeControl, and more.

- **Adaptive UI:** in addition to showing how each control responds to different form factors, the app itself is responsive and shows various methods for achieving adaptive UI.

- **Design & accessibility guidance**: design and accessibility pages help make the gallery a useful developer companion app.

## üöÄ Getting started

Quick start guide to building the WinUI 3 Gallery:


### 1. Set up the environment

> [!NOTE]
> The WinUI Gallery requires [Visual Studio 2022](https://visualstudio.microsoft.com/vs/) or later to build and Windows 10 or later to execute. If you're building an app with WinUI and Windows App SDK for the first time, follow these [installation instructions](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here).

**Required [Visual Studio components](https://learn.microsoft.com/windows/apps/get-started/start-here?tabs=vs-2022-17-10#required-workloads-and-components):**
- Windows application development

### 2. Clone the Repository

```powershell
git clone https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery.git
```

### 3. Open WinUIGallery.sln with Visual Studio and build!

Ensure that the `WinUIGallery` project is set as the startup project in Visual Studio.

> [!WARNING]
> Try deleting [`nuget.config`](nuget.config) and building again if you get the following build error:
> > Assets file 'C:\Users\\...\source\repos\WinUI-Gallery\WinUIGallery\obj\WinUIGallery\project.assets.json' not found. Run a NuGet package restore to generate this file.
>
> See [issue #1659: Broken repo build](https://github.com/microsoft/WinUI-Gallery/issues/1659).
