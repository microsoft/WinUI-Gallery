The Common directory contains classes that simplify application development.

Classes in the Common directory form part of your project and may be further enhanced to meet your
needs.  Care should be taken when altering existing methods and properties as incompatible changes
will require corresponding changes to code included in a variety of Visual Studio templates.  For
example, additional pages added to your project are written assuming that the original methods and
properties in Common classes are still present and that the names of the types have not changed.
